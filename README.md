# gorongosa-baboon-leavetaking-function

###Abstract
Although the function of greeting has been explored across primates, the function of its counterpart, leave-taking, remains unstudied. With evidence of orientation shifting towards the direction of parting in chacma baboons being an example of such behaviour to signal the end of social interaction, investigating its function seems the next natural step. Several functions of leave-taking have been suggested for humans, including increasing social bonding, providing information about separation, and managing conflict or competition. Here we test three hypotheses using wild chacma baboons: 1) social regulation, 2) signalling separation, and 3) risk management. We used an information theory approach to investigate these functional hypotheses of baboon leave-taking. We found less support for social regulation or separation indication as drivers of the behaviour, but results did support the use of body orientation in the direction of parting to manage risk, e.g. when there could be tension over valuable resources. We suggest that leave-taking in chacma baboons could have originated as a mechanism to decrease the risk of ending social interactions, especially to manage costly competition or mitigate conflict. Hence, the function of leave-taking could vary across primate species, depending on social systems, and levels of tolerance and competition.
